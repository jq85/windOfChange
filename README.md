# windOfChange
Open source project for developing smart Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT)

# I vs We
We hope this project will help to democratize the use of renewable energy from the wind, and to help strenghen the open source philosophy among other engineering disciplines.

# Looking for partners
Everyone is invited to colaborate in this project.
Since we're in the first development stage we need contributors with mechanical, electronics, design, engineering skills.

# Techs
* 2D and 3D modeling
* Thermodynamics
* Mechanical Engineering
* Electronics Engineering

# ToDo
